This `__init__.py` file serves to make the 'model' directory a Python package,
allowing its modules and submodules to be imported using dot notation.

This file itself does not perform any specific imports or initializations.
The primary model definitions, components, and utilities are located within
the submodules of this 'model' package, such as:
    - `network.py`: Defines main network architectures.
    - `modules/`: Contains various network building blocks like compression
                  modules, analysis/synthesis networks, layers, etc.
